Iris Flower Classification 

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to predict Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

Purpose: Showcase supervised machine learning on the classic Iris dataset.
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Methods:

Data preprocessing

Train-test split

Naive Bayes classification

Model evaluation using standard ML metrics

Future Work: Extend the project by experimenting with other models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and adding data visualization.
